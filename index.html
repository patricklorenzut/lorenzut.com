      <p>Hey, I’m Patrick Lorenzut.</p>

      <p>I’m a fiery human with a passion for giggles, rocking the boat, and situationally ugly websites. I want to bring humanity, empathy, community, and silliness into this absurd tech landscape.</p>
      
      <p>If you’re a small team with a big dream, I want to work with you. Remotely, either freelance or part-time, for between $40 and $120 per hour, depending on the good you’re doing and what you can afford.</p>

      <h2>THOSE PESKY <span>VALUES</span></h2>
    </header>
    <article> 

      <p>I value ridiculous laughs, tomfoolery, ballyhoo, attempting to frown while skipping, existential crises, type 2 fun, eco-friendly glitter, naked bike rides, ultimate frisbee, almond butter, expertly-roasted ‘mallows, bunny ears, funkadelic tunes, shower thoughts, and stories of romance.</p>

      <p>Pity for my bank account I also value human rights, equity, inclusivity, the environment, future generations, human connection, physical health, mental health, minimalism, and slowness.</p>

      <p>And perhaps most damning is what I <i>don’t</i> value. I don’t value tech advancements for the sake of tech advancements. And I don’t value tech advancements for the principal sake of monetary advancements.</p>

      <p>To make matters worse, I have strong moral resolve, making the devilish angel on my shoulder a royal pain in my dick sometimes, yelling so loudly that I keel over in pain when I don’t do what I’m told.</p>

      <p>But with my as-so-called “obnoxious” values comes a wonderful side: if I’m  on your team, I will rock your fucking world. I will pour my heart, soul, and brain into every minute. I will spread the word. I will involve my community. I will stick my neck out for you. I will… [gasp]… think about you after hours.</p>

      <small>
        I must caveat that my values have radically grown over the years. For example, I started a <i>Sports Handicapping</i> company when I was 22 (I’m 32 now) and worked from a <i>Deals and Coupons for Shit Nobody Needs</i> website from 26-28. Eww and double eww. That is to say, I’m not here to judge people for where they are on their journeys. I’m on Team Everybody… which includes the people I disagree with. But I’ll be damned if I work on something misaligned with who I am.
      </small>

      <p>Here are more deets about specific values that may impact you.</p>

      <h3>minimalism</h3>
      <p>Minimalism, both digitally and physically, is wicked important to me. As is mobility. It’s the lifestyle that I need in order to be creatively expressive. I’ve tried the permanent desk thing. I’ve tried the permanent location thing. And - I’m not knocking that life for others - those things just don’t work for me.</p>

      <p>Because of that, it’s important that I don’t add any hardware to my life. I’ve got my 15” MacBook Pro, and I don’t want anything else. I mean, if you need me to carry around a Raspberry Pi or a Jetson TX2 (both things I’ve carried around before) or something similar in size, we can certainly talk about that. But if you need me to work on hardware that won’t fit into my backpack… I can’t. I just can’t. I’ll go freaking crazy, and everybody will lose. That said, I’m happy to fire up as many ec2 instances as you need!</p>

      <p>Minimalism spills into every design, block of code, piece of copy, and database schema that I create. It’s a huge net positive in both my personal and professional lives, a positive that will translate to you... but sometimes it might make me mildly annoying.</p>

      <h3>slowness</h3>
      <p>Cal Newport doesn’t know me, but I’m his biggest fanboy. I strongly believe that people with non-robot brains must take precautionary measures in order to avoid the suction of the attention economy. Well, if they want to be efficient, anyway.</p>

      <p>I’m the fastest project-getter-doner I know… and it’s precisely because I go so slowly. After all, slow is smooth and smooth is fast, as once said somebody.</p>

      <p>I don’t have email on the greyscale phone that I leave at home more than half the time. I don’t have any social media accounts. I literally plan every single computer session with pencil and paper before opening my laptop lid. And my wifi is disabled when I don’t need it (which is most of the time, given the magic of local environments). Maybe I’m more susceptible to this technological distraction than most people? It’s certainly possible. But I think, really, that I’m only more aware of it.</p>

      <p>For most projects I spend <em>at least</em> as much time offline as I do online. Sometimes - though this might not be true for your project - I work offline for days at a time.</p>

      <p>I’m going to die way too soon to spend time pretending to be busy.</p>

      <h3>fastness</h3>
      <p>So as to sound as contradictory as possible, I’m faster than I am slow. I employ the above tactic to get shit done. But really, deep down, I’m all about speed. </p>

      <p>This means that I iterate. A lot.</p>

      <p>And iteration inherently means saying “I was wrong”. I’ve developed quite a fond relationship with being wrong, and I’ve learned that that truth will always bubble up in the long run, so better to admit you were wrong after 2 hours than after 12 years, right?</p>

      <p>Sunk cost bias is a real butthole. I try my best never to succumb to it. And I’ll hope the same from you. And I know that that will require a lot of…</p>


      <h3>communication</h3>
      <p>Communication is my new favorite thing. I didn’t use to be so great at this, gladly trading comfort now for pain later, but slowly I started to compile a mental spreadsheet of the times when I did and didn’t communicate fully. And, perhaps to nobody’s surprise, I started to accept that communication, almost always, regardless of how uncomfortable, is the long-term best play.</p>

      <p>So now I embrace it. Hooray vulnerable conversations! In fact I embrace it so hard that it’s sometimes hard to comprehend how pre-communicative-Patrick could have moved through this world.</p>

      <p>Speaking of communication, I’ll be in Mexico for the entire month of November. Then from Dec 1 to Feb 15 I’ll be doing a South American motorcycle trip with my seriously-you-can’t-even-imagine-how-wonderful-she-is partner. I’ll be working up to 20 hours per week during this time, but my schedule might be a little wonky.</p>

      <h2>HELP, I CAN’T FIND MY <span>EGO</span></h2>
    </header>
    <article>      
      <p>I believe that all websites, books, products, etc should have a clearly defined purpose (while staying open to iteration) before the build process starts. </p>

      <p>Why are we doing this? </p>
      
      <p>What are our values and goals? </p>
      
      <p>What and who are we trying to change? </p>
      
      <p>What would success look like for us?</p>
      
      <p>Attractive design and clean code is ubiquitous these days. But if you don’t take an emotional deep-dive to answer these questions… who cares? Sure you’ll have a pretty product. But will you have the <em>right</em> pretty product?</p>
      
      <p>When you start your project by asking and answering these questions, it quickly becomes clear that the “why” of your project is most certainly <em>not</em> “to make a cool app” or “to build a pretty website”. So then, we realize that the code is but a means to an end. Whether we end up building something from scratch or pulling off a glorified open source duct-tape job… it makes no difference.</p>
      
      <p>Well, actually, it <em>does</em> make a difference. The duct-tape path, when available, wins every time. Because speed. The goal is the result, and any frivolous steps on that journey are a distraction… potentially a monumentally costly one.</p>
      
      <p>For example, Luxonis needed <a href="https://luxonis.com">a new website</a>. They “why” was to create a unified front for all of our projects (as they’d been spread out across 3 different websites before that) and to convey technological capability through polished copy and a polished design, so that when people found our Crowd Supply campaign they’d have zero seed of a doubt as to whether or not we could deliver on our promise.</p>
      
      <p>The purpose was not “to make a website”. Thankfully, because I had to do this task using only spare hours found ‘neath the cracks between other projects. So rather than <em>actually</em> make a website, I just forked <a href="https://github.com/creativetimofficial/vue-argon-design-system">this</a>, made a few tweaks, and called it a day. And as a fun bonus, I got to learn <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/">Vue</a>!</p>
      
      <p>Not dissimilar was the Machine Learning work I did, which was based on the premade <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab">Deeplabv3+</a>, then trained with a premade dataset, then patched with code almost entirely found on either <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Sure I <em>could</em> make things from scratch. And for many many years I did. I took great pride in doing so, despising WordPress developers and laughing at people who needed frameworks like Bootstrap. I built <a href="https://pickmonitor.com">this</a>, <a href="https://dealcatcher.com">this</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dealcatcher-coupons-deals-shopping-app/id534634276">this</a> entirely from scratch, for example, even building a custom MVC framework because I was so obsessed with the ego of my custom creations.</p>
      
      <p>Then, through life events such as divorce, failed businesses, therapy, and travel, my ego started to shrivel (but still lingers, obviously) and I realized I was being an idiot. Or more accurately, my static cling to customization was no more than a twisted, illogical attempt at feeling important.</p>
      
      <p>These days every one of my web projects starts with a framework like VueJS, <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Every “custom” design is merely a retooling of something found on <a href="https://sketchrepo.com/">Sketch Repo</a>. Almost all chunks of code come from GitHub or from places like <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/">pyimagesearch</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Of course most people use frameworks, so I’m not seeking a cookie for that, but with my allergic reaction to reinventing the wheel I reckon that I spend less than a quarter of the time on your average task than your average creator. AND the results I cobble together are cleaner, faster, prettier, and more secure. Because a GitHub repo built over 8 months - even if it only takes 30 minutes to install, is generally more polished than a solution custom coded over two weeks.</p>
      
      <p>So if you’re looking to hire a developer who writes thousands of lines of code per day, pass on me. But if you’re looking to hire someone who gives zero shits about his code count - and instead funnels those shits into big picture results - I’m your guy.</p>

      <h2>MAD <span>SKILLS</span> FOR DAYS</h2>
    </header>
    <article> 
      <p>I’m still working on this section. It will be finished by EOD on Friday, Aug 30. I pinky promise.</p>

      <a class="image-wrap" href="/img/designs/showuply-4.png">
        <img src="/img/designs/showuply-4-browser.png" alt="Showuply"/>

        <img src="/img/designs/showuply-browser.png" alt="Showuply"/>
        <p>I've been an all-or-nothing person most of my life. It's mostly gone away in the past couple of years, as I've figured out who I am and what I want (not an easy task). But prior to that, I would make grand plans and have trouble following through. So I made this community to help people like me (there are a bunch of us) not quit when things got boring, or when we were feeling like imposters, or whatevs.</p>
      </a>

      <a class="image-wrap" href="/img/designs/feedhero.png">
        <img src="/img/designs/feedhero-browser.png" alt="Feed Hero"/>
        <p>I made this pretty sophisticated Twitter Relationship Manager tool to seriously encourage authentic Twitter relationships. And I got about 35 people to pay for it and use it. But over time, I (and many of my users) started to realize that the best way to have authentic relationships was actually to skip Twitter altogether.</p>
      </a>

      <a class="image-wrap" href="/img/designs/safecars.png">
        <img src="/img/designs/safecars-browser.png" alt="Safe Cars"/>
        <p>My (now ex) wife got in a bad car accident, and when she went to get a new car we couldn't find a single service that let you search for used cars by safety AND price at the same time. So I compiled the data from a few different sources and made the site myself. We went with a 2009 Subaru Forester FWIW.</p>
      </a>
      
      <a class="image-wrap" href="/img/designs/noncents-1.png">
        <img src="/img/designs/noncents-1-browser.png" alt="Noncents"/>
      </a>
      <a class="image-wrap" href="/img/designs/noncents-2.png">
        <img src="/img/designs/noncents-2-browser.png" alt="Noncents"/>
        <p>I got into this crypto phase for... about two months... and then I realized that I didn’t care at all, so this website went bye bye.</p>
      </a>
      <a class="image-wrap" href="/img/designs/justfreakingpublish.png">
        <img src="/img/designs/justfreakingpublish-browser.png" alt="Just Freaking Publish"/>
        <p>I quite like accountability tools/communties/ideas. Discipline is overrated.</p>

      <a class="image-wrap" href="/img/designs/commute-guardian.png">
        <img src="/img/designs/commute-guardian-browser.png" alt="Commute Guardian"/>
        <p>Made at and for Luxonis. This one is still publicly live.</p>

      <a class="image-wrap" href="/img/designs/beeminder.png">
        <img src="/img/designs/beeminder-browser.png" alt="Beeminder"/>
        <p>A mockup I made for my friends at Beeminder. Because I really love their product but could never get past the 1990s web design. This is the only of these design screenshots that was snapped from Sketch... all the rest were taken from live websites (though most on my local server).</p>
