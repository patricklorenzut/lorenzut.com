  <!--
  <p>I'm a radically marginal human with a passion for giggles, rocking the boat, and ugly websites. Co-creator of <a href="https://toogether.app">Toogether</a> and <a href="https://radicallymarginal.com">Radically Marginal</a>, I want to bring diversity, humanity, community, and silliness into this absurd tech landscape.</p>
  <p>Previously I've "earned" upwards of $140k per year as a Machine Learning Engineer, iOS Developer, Front-end Developer, UI Designer, and various other things. But that life did't mesh with my values. So <a href="mailto:heylorenzut@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you want help with an impactful project... regardless of your funds.</p>
