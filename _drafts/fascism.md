# Why I Want to Save the World From Fascism

Back in the day I used to be a successful online entrepreneur. Depending on your definition of success, of course. I was netting $40k per year from a site that required one hour per week of my time. And another $100k per year from a day job. To me, that counted as successful.

And then, out of nowhere, I started to battle with depression and existential crises. And like any good Brené Brown disciple, I didn't shy away from them. I leaned in.

In 2016 I started going full Tylder Durden on my life. I burnt it all down. Quit the cushy day job. Sold the cushy side hustle (I was just going to shut it down, but <a href="">this guy</a> convinced me to sell it for $75k instead). Moved across the country. Hired a life coach. Hired a therapist. And then willingly broke my own heart when I divorced my childhood best friend.

I don’t regret any of those things. But fuck. You honestly wouldn’t believe me if I told you how many times I cried myself to sleep. How many times I took a shower just so I could cry without my hostel-mates hearing me.

Following that, I hard-quit the internet. I just needed a break from it all. It wasn’t logical, and I knew that. But sometimes the bigger picture is more important. I <em>needed</em> a break.

So I shut down a few SaaS projects, deleted my entire email list, and deleted all of my social media accounts.  after that. No social media. No websites. I did some freelance to pay the bills, but otherwise went full-on hermit mode.

And by hermit mode, I mean that I experienced the outside world. I slow-traveled for 15 months, spending a month or more in Uruguay, Mexico, and , I broke my own heart, then I spent many months in therapy, and then I hard quit the internet to travel for 15 months. Because I had to deal with myself.dealing with myself
