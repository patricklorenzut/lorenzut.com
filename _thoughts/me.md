# Starting With an Honest Assessment of Who I Am And What I Want

The reason I’m so attracted to the mental (and physical) health space, is because I’m really well equipped to help. Because I can almost certainly resonate with you, whoever you are. Because I’ve been many, many different people over the course of my life.

I’ve been a maximalist and minimalist, and now live somewhere in between. I’ve made more than $140k for years and also less than $20k for years, and now live somewhere in between. I’ve struggled with different addictions, have been wholly abstinent, and now live somewhere in between. I’ve owned my own house, and also lived out of my car, and have now found the nice balance of renting a room. I was a homebody for most of my life, and now I travel internationally (I’m writing this from Chile), if I’m being honest, a bit more than I’d like, and soon I’ll settle somewhere in between. I know what it’s like to hate my body and to love my body. To be hopelessly stuck in a deadend marriage, and to be fully in love.

In other words: I really freaking love finding the edges. It thrills me and makes me feel alive. And at the same time, I do a lot of work to eventually find something that sort of resembles balance.

I’m the most *genuinely* open-minded person that I know. And I’m the best person at implementing big change that I know.

But of course, I’m majorly flawed.

If you ask me to [rate](https://designingyour.life/) Work, Play, Love, and Health from 1 to 10, Work is the *only* one that consistently falls below an 8. It’s at about a 2, and has been for many years.

Why? Because I’m not good enough. Unless I’m curing cancer, I'm not good enough. And because of this, even when I find something that would otherwise be halfway rewarding, I’m gravitationally pulled to pivot to something MORE rewarding.

On top of that, I’m a perfectionist tinkerer to a HUGE fault. Incredibly good at making beautiful designs, and incredibly bad at leaving them alone. Good at coming up with ideas, and bad at not pivoting. Basically, I'm really good at X, but really bad at accepting that X is good enough, and because of this I'm forever trying to turn X into Y.

To add to the list:

I overpursue things and burn out. I impulsively jump into things without thinking them out. I’m impatient and want my cookie now. I try to jump right from step 1 to step 38 without even considering that there might be requisite steps in between. I recreate a 2% better wheel instead of collaborating, because my ego wants to be the one to take all the glory. 

Combine all of these things with too much freedom, no accountability, and untethered access to an infinity of distraction (aka the internet), and it’s a bad formula.

I don’t like these things. But it’s important that I’ve accepted them. And although I wish progress was faster, I am happy to report that I’m 100% getting better at making these things less true.

## Things I Know That I Want

1. I want to build something that my parents are proud of. For many years I've tried to hide from them what I was doing, because I wanted to be cool and edgy and didn't want their judgment. But now the truths are two: first, that I love my parents and want them to be an increasingly present part of my life, so I want to do work that I’m excited to talk with them about, and that they’re excited to hear about. And second, that their direction has had a huge impact on who I am, and even though sometimes the apple falls from a different tree altogether... usually it doesn’t. I’ve now done enough emotional work that I feel no need to try to be my own person purely for its own sake.

2. I want to be stoked when people (that I like) ask "what do you do?" Since birth I’ve been told that I can do anything that I set my mind to. Largely I believe that to be true. But also, how can I ever fully set my mind to something that I’m embarrassed to talk about? There’s been a lot of shame surrounding projects I’ve done in the past, because I simply haven’t been able to own "Vulnerability Coach" or "Accountability Coach" or other roles that I’ve tried on.

3. I don’t want to work alone ever again. I’ve tried every possible mechanism of doing so in the past, and forever I get torn apart by perfectionism, Imposter Syndrome, and Shiny Object Syndrome... three diseases that have *not* inflicted me when I’ve worked with others. I don’t want to keep trying different accountability groups and productivity hacks. I have a proven formula that works, that’s more fun anyway: work with others.

4. I want our project to have a clear marketing strategy from day one. I *like* reaching out to people... but there needs to be a clear first step of who to tell, what to tell them, and why they should care.

5. I don’t want to sell shovels. The saying goes that if you want to make money, don’t be the one mining for gold. Be the one selling the shovels to the gold miners. Yeah, obviously that works. And I don’t want to do it. I don’t want to make my living exploiting the dreams of others. Now, if I can genuinely *help* others achieve their dreams, that’s different.

6. I want a clear path to financial sustainability. I live off of USD $2,000 per month and I want for this project to pay me that within the first year. And eventually I’d love to get back to the $140,000 per year that I used to make as a software engineer. I’m not huge on capitalism, and I don’t live a lavish lifestyle... but at the same time I do love being able to walk into Whole Foods and buy whatever I want without even thinking about it. But not more than $140k. That’s my limit, and I’m defining it publicly now.

7. I want to partner with a good cause - if we’re highly financially successful - to give it all away. To practice what I preach in my personal life... I don’t want to see what I turn into if I become a billionaire. Depending on what our end product is, I’d like to figure out a way to give every cent of profit away to, for example, an organization like Black Girls Code. That organization calls to me because my current thought is that increasing equity in tech (and especially in artificial intelligence) might be the most important thing we can do to save the world. I’ll be talking more about this in future posts.

8. I want to sleep well at night, and be fully present with my special lady friend and also my special friend friends. I have a tendency to get completely consumed by ventures, sabotaging relationships, hobbies, and personal hygiene in the process. I expect that to happen to a small degree here, too, but I want to take intentional measures up front to make sure that I maintain these other parts of my life. Because my life, other than the work piece that I'm figuring out, couldn’t get much better.

## My Biggest Questions

I want to exist in the world of self-help. Although I contend that title, because really I want it to be "together" help. My biggest questions, though, are these:

1. Is it okay for me to try to help people with accountability and imperfection? These are two areas that I still MASSIVELY struggle with, and they’re the two areas that I'm most drawn to creating solutions for. But it sometimes feels incredibly phony since I don’t have the answers. Whereas it wouldn’t feel at all phony to address things like love, acceptance, fitness, diet, etc.
2. Where do I find the people who struggle with this enough to pay for it? Sure, most people will admit to having a problem with accountability, or maintaining healthy relationships. But unlike upgrading your mailing list software, there's no obvious return on investment. And so it's a much harder sales pitch. Similarly, it's not as easy as saying "replace MailChimp with this better thing I made." It's trying to get people to pay for something they’re not already accustomed to paying for.
3. How do I start? The two places I’m leaning right now are 
    1. *Don't* start. Don’t start making anything that is. Instead start emailing people who I think might relate, and starting conversations. Maybe assemble a slack group of people with similar thoughts who might want to work on something together.
    2. Start by saving the long game for later. Right now, create lightweight, very affordable versions of things like Fathom Analytics, Intercom, Canopy, etc as a short term marketing solution to start building interest, and then use that interest to start pitching mental health. I know this seems way out of the way, but it's something that I know how to do, and offers such an incredibly clear marketing path. I think creating "Intentionally Imperfect Software for Brand New Solopreneurs" could be quite successful in its own right.

More soon.
