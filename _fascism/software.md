# Software Will Not Fix This Mental Health Problem

I’m pretty open when it comes to talking about my mental health struggles (mild as they may be in the scheme of things). To my surprise and absolute joy, others have largely responded to my struggles by telling me about *their* struggles.

This is great!

This tells me that people are ready to talk about this. They usually just need someone else to go first. Well, Mrs. Puikin didn't assign me the "line leader" position in 3rd grade for nothing! I love going first!

But when I’m talking to software developers, or online entrepreneurs, the conversation almost always takes the same turn. Almost always I hear about a newfound idea for a piece of software that could solve the problem.

I appreciate these moments deeply. In no way am I making fun of these suggestions or of these people. I'm so happy that we’re talking about this.

But I think these attempts are wickedly short-sighted. They don't see how deep the problem is. And worse, they reek of desperation.

What kind of desperation? The same kind I didn't admit to myself for years. The kind where my subconcious was telling me that I had to start talking to people, start being vulnerable, start - heaven for bid - designing a solution that might not scale so easily and might not let me make passive income.

When you spend your whole adult life writing code... when you spend your whole life *solving problems* by writing code, and someone presents you with a new problem: **you write code for it.** It’s just what you do. It's how it is. And breaking away from that is - or was for me - a real kick in the balls.

You mean I have to (more or less) abandon my skillset that I've worked for 16 years to build? The skillset that can get me a 6-figure job at the drop of a hat without even really trying? To become some weird hybrid of a blogger and a therapist-coach-thingy?

**No thanks!**

No thanks no thanks no thanks.

Until eventually, when you want to solve a problem badly enough...

I want to save the world by helping tech workers love themselves. By addressing mental health. By making it okay to talk about things, and to feel things, and to want things, and to not know. From talking about depression to career struggles to admitting that we might not know what we want to do or if we should switch jobs, or if we actually want that raise, or if it’s worth it to move our entire family across the country, or how to respect ourselves enough to take care of ourselves even when we’re working long hours…

I feel that if we can talk about all of those things then we can start to figure out who we really are deep down inside. The four-year-old versions of ourselves that didn’t feel the pressure to keep up with the joneses.

That we can stop being so hard on ourselves, and stop trying to live up to other people’s expectations.

And that hopefully we can stop building drone strike technology just because it pays well.

People in tech wield a lot of power, and I posit that people who love themselves will be way less likely to use their power to destroy the world.

This software problem isn't a software problem. It's a human problem.

So instead of closeting myself in a room and building a habit tracking app - the approach I honestly WANT to take - I'm going to be reaching out to other humans and trying to build a solution around mentorship, community, and shared experiences.

For human sake.

More soon.
