# Be A Worse Version of Yourself
## Self hurt coaching for generic white dudes who want to stop living someone else's dream.

I live the life that you want to live. And you live the life that I used to live. So I could sell you the solution. I could coach you, build you up, teach you how to live the life of your dreams.

But I’d fail. Because that's not how it works. And I think deep down inside you already know that.

You want to think that you can read a book or take a course or even hire a coach to fix your impressively unsatisfying life.

You want to keep the six figure job, the wife, the generic-ass house, the friends.

You're not trying to sink into a wallowing depression in order to  find yourself, accept yourself, love yourself, and change things. You just want somebody to tell you to go to yoga once a week or some shit. You want to keep everything nice and safe and comfortable and also make it wildly better. At the same time. You want to have your cake and eat it too.

You want a miracle bandaid.

But here's the thing. Your life ain't broken. So you can't fix it. Sure, you can add a deck and do a kitchen remodel. But you can't REALLY change anything.

That’s where I come in. I'll help you break your life. So you can rebuild it however the fuck you want. And heck, I might even be a useful companion during the rebuild process. But no promises.

Who am I? Consider me an expert in sunk cost bias.

I see the past differently than you do.

You see a job that you've already sunk 4 years into, or an industry that you've already sunk 12 years into, or a relationship that you've already sunk 7 years into...

You see those things and your brain subconsciously calculates that you need to make them work. That you can ask for a raise, sure. You can get a new certification, sure. You can ask to spend a weekend out with the boys, sure.

But it never crosses your mind to stop throwing good time after bad. Or maybe it does cross your mind in the tiniest of flashes, but then you punch that thought right in its face before it really has a chance to explain itself to you.

You're like the guy who buys tickets to the baseball game, and then you get mega sick and it's pouring outside and you don't want to go, but you go anyway because you already paid for the tickets. 

Dude. What's done is done. You illogical motherfucker.

Look, if your life is perfect except for those extra 5 lbs, or perfect except for a little too much stress... then go buy a self-help book and fix that thing.

But if your life seems pretty damn great on paper, and still you feel like a meaningless sack of shit, I'm your guy.

Because I've been there. I've led the meaningless existence. I've been married to the wrong person. I've worked at a job that killed my playful heart one day at a time. And over the course of many painful years I managed to burn all that to the ground.

I've also climbed back up, rebuilt my life beautifully, have purpose, and am generally full of joy. But hey, let's save the feel-good stories for another day, shall we?

The important thing here is that I'm happier than I ever have been in my whole life, and I'm at least 4% confident that the same could be true for you.

## The Self Hurt Coaching Plan

Keeping in mind that I'm completely full of shit and am exactly 0% qualified in any professional way, let me tell you what's wrong with your life and how we're going to fix it.

It's simple.

**You're introspective enough to know that something's wrong, but not bold enough to do anything about it.**

And how are we going to fix it? 

You’re going to start by wiring me $7,500 for my coaching services.

Whoah, fuck. That’s expensive!

No shit.

For two reasons.

1. You’re trying to be bold and blow up your life. You need to be invested in this destruction or it stands 0% chance of working. Don't believe me? Go spend $17 on a self help book and see what changes.
2. I simply don't care enough about you to ruin your life for 3 easy payments of $49. I'm not trying to be mean with that. It's just true. This is, maybe surprisingly, VERY emotionally draining work for me. It fulfills me deeply and it's what I want to be doing, and it's what I want to be doing. But I need to be FULLY invested to do it.
